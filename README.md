This is a tic-tac-toe game I built as my first project for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program. It is a single-page application with working user authentication using GA's project API.

I built the front-end for the application, including the game logic, authentication, and User Interface.
This project is currently in its first version, and will be extensively updated using CSS and SASS to create a truly user-friendly, aesthetically appealing, and entertaining application.

Project Development Process:
1. Build User Authentication testing with curl scripts
2. Build Gameboard
3. Build event handlers and CRUD callback functions
4. Connect Gameboard to CRUD functionality
5. Build game logic
6. Add working game count button.

Problem Solving Strategy:
Every time I encountered problems I would try to break them down to solvable problems. As new programmer, I researched plenty to solve problems.

Technologies Used:
1. HTML
2. CSS, SASS & Bootstrap
3. JavaScript & jQuery
4. AJAX
